        <p class="person_details">I am an IoT Project Manager currently completing my Higher Vocational Education degree in IoT project management with a focus on wireless networks at <a href="https://www.tucsweden.se/utbildning/program/iot-projektor-tradlosa-nat-distans-helsingborg/">TUC Sweden AB</a>, with graduation expected in May 2026. 
        <br>
        With a background spanning several industries, I bring a strong analytical approach, adaptability, and hands-on problem-solving skills into my work.
        <br><br>
        I have practical experience with wireless communication technologies, device provisioning, cloud-based IoT platforms, and project workflows that involve both hardware and software. I enjoy translating technical requirements into clear project plans, coordinating cross-functional work, and ensuring that solutions are robust, maintainable, and aligned with the client's operational needs.
        <br><br>
        My main focus is delivering reliable IoT systems through structured project management, clear communication, and a strong commitment to quality.
